How to test?

Compile Android APK file:

    cordova build android

Go to

    project-directory => platforms => android => build => outputs => apk

You will find this:

    android-armv7-debug.apk

Download above APK on your Android (real) [e.g. Nexus6] device.

----------------------------

Personally, I always use following app to share HUGE_Files between Desktop (Windows/Mac) and Android.

    https://rtcxp.com/fs/#unique-room-id

I use Google Chrome browser both on Desktop and Android.

----------------------------

Compile iOS app:

    cordova build ios


Open XCode, select your real iPhone6 (or an emulator) and then click "Build and then run current scheme" button from the tool-box.

It will auto-install your iOS app on your real iPhone device or on emulators.

----------------------------

Test on emulators?

    cordova emulate android
    cordova emulate ios


----------------------------

Now test "VideoConferencing" app:

Open Following page on your MacBook's Google Chrome browser:

    https://rtcmulticonnection.herokuapp.com/demos/Video-Conferencing.html

Enter a UNIQUE-room-id and "JOIN".

Now open "VideoConferencing" app either on iPhone6 or Android device.

Enter same UNIQUE-room-id and click "JOIN".

Now both your mobile devices and desktop can talk with each other.
